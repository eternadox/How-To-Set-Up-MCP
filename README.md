# How To Set Up MCP (1.8.x) for Client Developing

## Step 1 
> If you already have an IDE, you can skip this.
- Choose your IDE: The two most popular are Eclipse and IntelliJ.
- My personal preference is IntelliJ (Make sure to install the Community version!)
- You can download Eclipse [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer), and IntelliJ [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
## Step 2
- Once you have an IDE, go ahead and make a folder.
- Call the folder your client's name, or whatever you would like.
- Next, you need MCP. You can either get [Maven-MCP](https://github.com/Marcelektro/MavenMCP-1.8.9/), or [regular MCP](https://github.com/Marcelektro/MCP-919).
- Once you have either one downloaded, extract it in your folder.
## Step 3
- Open your IDE, and create a new project from existing sources, if you are on MavenMCP click Maven Project, and if you are on regular MCP click Eclipse Project.
> For Maven Projects, select the project file as pom.xml. <br>
> For Eclipse/Regular MCP Projects, click on the eclipse folder.
